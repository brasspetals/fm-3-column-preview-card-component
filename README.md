## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Keyframe Animations

This one is just a bit of fun animation practice. ðŸ˜„ The animations are only for the "desktop" layout, which for this project is 830px width and higher. I think a similar but vertical, "slide down" animation for mobile would be lost on most users due to the smaller screen height and would also be too much movement for a small screen.

`prefers-reduced-motion` was used to prevent the animations from occuring for those who prefer motion reduced. I also added aria labels to the card links to make them a bit more descriptive.
